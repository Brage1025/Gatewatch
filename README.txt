--------------------------THE-MOST-POG-README-THAT-EVER-WAS----------------------------

So this is mainly the HTML, CSS and JS prject I've messed around with during the so
called "Kartlegging" and the first week on Fullstack. So most of this based on whatever
we went through in class, and intresting thinks I've either read about, watched on YT*
or Scrimba.

I dunno how good this is. And there is some changes that I'd like to fix in the future
at some point. Like the pillars on the sides alongside further scaling optimizations.
Fixing spelling mistakes would also be cool.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I needed to change all the following:

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div class="img-container"> with <figure class="img-container"/> and before you ask;
YES I know that figure is self contained. But since I've was doing html heracy and
used <div></div>s The page breaks if I try and fix it, and I blame it on me starting
with this before I kenw that <div></div> is BANNED 

The same with this tbh:
<div class="planeswalker-info"> with <article class="planeswalker-info">

--------------------------------------RANTING-ZONE--------------------------------------

You have no idea how many hours it took to fix my design and still have a working site.
My god, don't start with <div></div>

--------------------------------------NOTES---------------------------------------------

The cat cam is the highlight of any coding lecture.

*YT = YouTube.com

I'd to get some concrete feedback

The restingplace project is just something I found online and tried to copy. How and
why it works? I'm not completely sure myself. And since it uses some functions we've
not learned about I can't do anything else than look forwards to learning that at some
point.
